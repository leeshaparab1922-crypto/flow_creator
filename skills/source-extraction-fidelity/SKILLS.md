description: Fidelity rules for extracting content from source material — quote code exactly, preserve verbatim benchmark figures, and flag unreadable sources rather than guessing. Use when scraping web pages, reading local documents, or analysing research papers for the research report.

Apply these rules when extracting content from any source (web page, local document, or research paper):

- **Quote code exactly — never paraphrase.** When a source contains a code snippet, command, or configuration block, reproduce it verbatim. Do not rewrite, summarize, or "clean up" code from a source.
- **Preserve verbatim benchmark figures.** Numeric results, benchmark tables, and performance figures must be extracted exactly as written in the source. Never round, estimate, or summarize away the numbers — exact figures matter.
- **Flag unreadable sources.** If a page cannot be scraped, a file cannot be read, or content is paywalled, bot-blocked, truncated, or otherwise inaccessible, state this explicitly rather than guessing at what it might contain.
